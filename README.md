gbraad's Analogue Clock: SVG based desktop clock
================================================

Based on my older project [html5-clock](https://github.com/gbraad/).

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This uses Sciter-JS to run a small, resizable, transparent clock omn the desktop.

### Run
```
PS> clock.exe
```
